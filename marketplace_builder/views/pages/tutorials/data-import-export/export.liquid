Exporting data can be done using either the CLI or the raw export API. This can be useful when test data is needed for a service, e.g. in a stagin environment.

## Data export with the CLI

platformOS CLI offers the `marketplace-kit data export` command. It accepts one option:

- --path (short: -p): A file path to a json file which will be created by the CLI and where the exported data is stored

Under the hood, the CLI uses the export API that's described in the next section. However, using the CLI provides some major benefits:

- leveraging the CLI's authentication mechanism (i.e. you don't need to manually send your authentication token)
- writing downloaded data directly to file system
