With `properties` you can create your custom fields for storing the data.
In those properties you can also store the `id` of existing object.
Then you can fetch those data with `model(join_on_property: String!)` or `user(join_on_property: String!) field in GraphQL.

In order to export/import such data with relations preserved you need to define them in models schema files by `belongs_to` attribute.

```yaml
#### marketplace_builder/custom_model_types/house.yaml
name: house
properties:
- name: address
  type: string
```

```yaml
# marketplace_builder/custom_model_types/cars.yaml
name: cars
properties:
- name: color
  type: string
- name: house_id
  type: integer
  belongs_to: House
```
