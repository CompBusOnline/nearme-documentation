## What is Custom Model Type?

**Custom Model Type is an object that describes all Customization objects that belongs to it.**

To fully understand Custom Model Types you first need to understand basic fuction of Customization objects which is to create, read, update and delete data. The organization of how this data is structured within Customization and persisted in our backend systems is defined by Custom Model Type files.

Head to [Persisting Data With Customization](/tutorials/custom-model-types/persisting-data-with-customizations) Tutorial to fully understand the process based on todo list example.


## Custom Model Types use cases

* Think of them as a custom DB table, which allows you to build highly customized features.
* Use them to group Custom Attributes, and allow the user to provide multiple values for each of them.

For example you can build a table that will store a user's favorite books. Each book has an author, title and a number of pages. These three fields are Custom Attributes. Thatâ€™s why you can use Custom Model Type to group Custom Attributes.

Now you can build a form that allows users to add multiple books attached to their user profile (using GraphQL).

[Custom Address](/tutorials/custom-attributes/custom-addresses), for example, is a Custom Model with Custom Attributes attached to it for your convenience. Custom Models you create are used in the same way as our built-in one.

## Defining

Custom Model Type definitions are placed in the `custom_model_types` directory.

The example below shows the BlogPost Custom Model Type `custom_model_types/blog_post.yml`:

```yaml
name: blog_post
properties:
- name: title
   type: string
- name: content
   type: text
```

## Configuration Properties

| Property                 | Description | Required |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| name                     | Name of your model. Best practice is to keep it lower case. Example: `user_application` | Yes      |
| properties               | Array of properties you want to contain within your models. Equivalent of a column in a database table | No       |
| instance_profile_types   |             | No       |
| relationship_types       |             | No       |
| transactable_types       |             | No       |

# Form configuration
