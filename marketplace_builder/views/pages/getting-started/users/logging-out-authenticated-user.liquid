This guide will help you create an authentication form to log out authenticated users. 

## Requirements

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with the required directory structure for your code base, and understand the concept of pages and users. 

* [Required Directory Structure](/how-platformos-works/platformos-components)
* [Pages](/get-started/pages/pages)
* [Users](/get-started/users/users) 

## Steps

Logging out an authenticated user is a two-step process:

1. Create log out form
2. Embed the log out form

### Step 1: Create log out form

Create a form `log_out.liquid` in the `marketplace_builder/form_configurations` directory:

{% raw %}

```liquid
---
name: log_out
resource: Session
---

{% form method: 'delete' %}
  <input type="submit" value="Log Out" />
{% endform %}
```

{% endraw %}

The difference from logging in, is that you want to destroy the session. You have to send a DELETE request by providing the `method: delete` attribute to the `form` tag. 

### Step 2: Embed the log out form 

Create a page `log_out.liquid` in the `views/pages` directory to make the log out available at `/log-out`:  

{% raw %}

```liquid
---
slug: log-out
---
<h2>Log out</h2>
{% render_form 'log_out' %}
```

{% endraw %}


## Next steps
Congratulations! You created a log out for authenticated users. Now you can learn about resetting a user's password:
