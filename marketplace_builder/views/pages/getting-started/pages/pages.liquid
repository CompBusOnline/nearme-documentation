**Pages** are the most essential components of our platform, that define content displayed at a given path. All pages have to be located in the `views/pages` directory. Each page is represented by a single file with `liquid` extension.

## Page configuration

See below a sample page configuration file, with explanations for each element:

{% raw %}

### views/pages/my-page.html.liquid

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
slug: my-page
layout_name: my_custom_layout
---
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paragraph explaining what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                                                                          | Default     | Example            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------ |
| `slug`        | Defines the url at which this page will be accessible. Assuming your site domain is https://example.com, you will be able to access the page at https://example.com/`<slug>`.        | n/a         | `my-page`          |
| `layout_name` | Defines which layout from `views/layouts/` you would like to use. If you don't want to use any layout, set it to empty string. It will be equivalent to just rendering page content. | application | `my_custom_layout` |

Everything after the front matter is the body of the page.

## Homepage

The Homepage slug is `/`, which will work for both https://example.com and https://example.com/. See this sample file for configuring the home page:

{% raw %}

### views/pages/home.html.liquid

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
slug: /
---
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my home page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paragraph explaining what we do&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

## Formats

To define which format the endpoint will be available for, place `.<format>` before the file extension.

| Format name | Example filename           |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `html`      | about-us.html.liquid       |
| `xml`       | orders.xml.liquid          |
| `csv`       | users-report.csv.liquid    |
| `json`      | coordinates.json.liquid    |
| `rss`       | feed.rss.liquid            |
| `css`       | datepicker.css.liquid      |
| `js`        | server-constants.js.liquid |
| `pdf`       | purchase-order.pdf.liquid  |
| `txt`       | notes.txt.liquid           |

## Accessing different formats

You can have multiple pages with the same slug, but with different formats, and access them at the same time.

For example you can have both `html`, `pdf` and `txt` version of a page with `Hello world`:

{% raw %}

### views/pages/hello.html.liquid

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
slug: hello
---
Hello world
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

{% raw %}

### views/pages/hello.pdf.liquid

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
slug: hello
---
Hello world
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

{% raw %}

### views/pages/hello.txt.liquid

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
slug: hello
---
Hello world
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

Those will be accessible under the URLs:

* `https://example.com/hello`
* `https://example.com/hello.pdf`
* `https://example.com/hello.txt`

Note that the `html` format is implicit, default, you don't need to specify it in the URL.
