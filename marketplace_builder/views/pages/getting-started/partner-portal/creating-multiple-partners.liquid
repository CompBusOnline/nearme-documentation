This guide will help you create multiple Partner accounts at once.

{% include "alert/note", content: "To be allowed to create one or more Partners, you should have the permission to create new Partners. You can check this on your User's information page." %}

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be able to log in to our Partner Portal.

* [Accessing our Partner Portal](/get-started/setup/accessing-partner-portal)

## Steps

Creating multiple Partners at once is a two-step process:

1. 	Locate Parent Partner
2. Create multiple Subpartners

### Step 1: Locate parent Partner
Each new Partner you create has to have a Parent Partner. In the menu on the left, click on `Partners`, and select the Parent Partner by clicking on its name. The information page of the Parent Partner is displayed.

### Step 2: Create multiple Subpartners
Click on `New multiple Partners`, enter their names separated by commas, for example `Test Partner, TestPartner 1, Test Partner 2`. Click on `Create`. A `We're preparing your Partner(s). Refresh page in a few minutes.` message is displayed, and if you refresh the page, you can see that the Partners have been created.

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have created multiple Partners at once. Now you can learn about updating Partners:
