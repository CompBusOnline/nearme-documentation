This guide will help you provide a layout for your email notifications.

## Requirements
As the concept of an email layout is the same as the concept of a layout for pages, you should understand the concepts of layouts and notifications, and should have created an email notification before.

* [Layouts](/get-started/pages/layouts)
* [Notifications](/get-started/notifications/notifications)
* [Creating an Email Notification](/get-started/notifications/creating-email-notification)

## Steps

Using email layouts is a two-step process:

1. Create email layout file
2. Edit email layout file

### Step 1: Create email layout file

The default layout file for all emails should be located in the `views/layouts` directory. Create a file named `mailer.html.liquid`.

### Step 2: Edit email layout file

The content of an email layout is slightly different from the content of a layout for pages, because it needs to be marked as an email layout.

Add the following to your email layout file `mailer.html.liquid`:

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&;gt;
  &lt;head&;gt;
    &lt;!-- it is good practice for emails to include inline styles rather than css. They can go here. --&;gt;
  &lt;/head&;gt;
  &lt;body&;gt;
    Header

    {{ content_for_layout }}

    Footer

  &lt;/body&;gt;
&lt;/html&;gt;
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

Where {% raw %}`{{ content_for_layout }}`{% endraw %} injects the body defined in the email notification into the layout. Without it, you would be sending a layout without actual content.
