This guide will help you associate an Authorization Policy with a page.

Similarly to `FormConfiguration` (see [Associating an Authorization Policy with Form Configuration](/get-started/authorization-policy/get-started/authorization-policy/associating-authorization-policy-formconfiguration)), you can also associate a policy with a page.

## Requirements
So that you can follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of Authorization Policy, and you should have created a page and an Authorization Policy.

* [Authorization Policy](/get-started/authorization-policy/authorization-policy)
* [Creating a Page](/get-started/pages/creating-page)
* [Adding an Authorization Policy](/get-started/authorization-policy/adding-authorization-policy)

## Steps

Associating an Authorization Policy with a page is a two-step process:

1. Create page
2. Add `authorization_policies` key to page configuration

### Step 1: Edit page configuration
Create a custom page that you only want users with the first name `John` to be able to access:

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
slug: john-private-page
---
&lt;h1&gt;Hello John!&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

### Step 2: Add `authorization_policies` key to page configuration
Add the `authorization_policies` key to page configuration
and specify the Authorization Policy for the page:

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
slug: john-private-page
authorization_policies:
  - only_allowed_by_johns
---
&lt;h1&gt;Hello John!&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
