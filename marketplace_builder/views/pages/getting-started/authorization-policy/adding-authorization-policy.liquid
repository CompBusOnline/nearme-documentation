This guide will help you add an Authorization Policy.

## Requirements
So that you can follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with the required directory structure for your code base, and understand the concept of Authorization Policy. You will also need the GraphQL query `current_user`, created in a previous tutorial.

* [Required Directory Structure](/how-platformos-works/platformos-components)
* [Authorization Policy](/get-started/authorization-policy/authorization-policy)
* [GraphQL query `current_user`](get-started/users/accessing-authenticated-user-data) (previous tutorial)

## Steps

Adding an Authorization Policy is a two-step process:

1. Create Authorization Policy file
2. Edit Authorization Policy file

### Step 1: Create Authorization Policy file
To add an Authorization Policy, create a file in the `marketplace_builder/authorization_policies/` directory, for example `only_allowed_by_johns.liquid`.

### Step 2: Edit Authorization Policy file
You are allowed to use all Liquid features and GraphQL in your Authorization Policy.

Assuming you have previously prepared the GraphQL query `current_user`, an example of a policy file can look like this:

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
name: only_allowed_by_johns
---
{% query_graph 'current_user', result_name: 'g' %}
{% if g.current_user.first_name == 'John' %}true{% endif %}
</code></pre>
{% endraw %}

In this example, only users with the first name `John` will be allowed to perform action with this policy.

## Next steps
Congratulations! You know how to add an Authorization Policy. Now you can learn about associating the Authorization Policy with a Form Configuration.
