If your multiple profiles happen to have the same custom attributes in them you can extract them to a container profile which will group them and could be used in different profiles.

* [Users](get-started/users/users)

#### marketplace_builder/user_profile_types/employee.yml
```yaml
name: employee
custom_attributes:
  - name: name
    attribute_type: string
  - name: email
    attribute_type: string
  - name: emergency_contact
    attribute_type: string
```

Having setup our general employee template you can define other profiles that will have fields from `employee` profile and some more.

#### marketplace_builder/user_profile_types/software_developer.yml
```yaml
name: software_developer
custom_attributes:
  - name: programming_languages
    attribute_type: array
```

#### marketplace_builder/user_profile_types/project_manager.yml
```yaml
name: project_manager
custom_attributes:
  - name: projects_managed
    attribute_type: array
```

Currently your form configuration require to have `enabled` field set up to true for profile to work.
