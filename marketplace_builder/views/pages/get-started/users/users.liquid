A **User** is an account that any of your users can have. Each user is assumed to have a unique email address.

**User Profiles** are roles in the marketplace. Each User Profile can be associated with any number of Custom Attributes, Categories, and Custom Model Types.

## The default User Profile

All users are assigned a User Profile named Default. If you don't want to distinguish one type of user from the other, you don't need to create any other user profiles.

## Sign up forms

**Sign up forms** allow users to sign up by entering their information in a form embedded in a page.

All forms should be located in the `marketplace_builder/form_configurations` directory.

{% include "alert/note", content: "Check out our <a href=''>API and Form Configurations</a> pages to learn more about sign up forms." %}

## User authentication

There are a couple of ways to authenticate a user in Platform OS,  the most common being through an email and password pair, which the user provided via a sign up form.
