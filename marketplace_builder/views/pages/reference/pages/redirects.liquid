**Redirects** are used to redirect one page to another using an HTTP status code.

## Example

Redirecting /my-page to /other-page using the 302 status:

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
---
slug: my-page
redirect_to: /other-page
redirect_code: 302
---
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

## Example 2

Usage params from GET request inside the `redirect_to` option to make SEO friendly redirects from one URL pattern to another.

Redirecting `/cars?maker=honda` to `/category/cars/honda` using the 301 status:

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
---
slug: cars
redirect_to: '/category/cars/{{ params.maker }}'
redirect_code: 301
---
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

## Available options

| `redirect_to` | endpoint which you want the user to be redirected to
| `redirect_code` | specifies the status of redirection. Can be either 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Found)
