This guide will help you create a Slack integration for Platform OS using API Call Notifications. 

## Requirements
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with creating API call notifications. You also have to have access to a Slack workspace, have enabled webhooks, and created an incoming webhook. You will need the webhook URL for creating the API call notification.  

* [Creating an API Call Notification](/get-started/notifications/creating-api-call-notification)
* [Creating an Incoming Webhook (Slack Documentation)](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks#getting-started)

## Steps

Integrating Slack using API call notifications is a two-step process:

1. Create API call notification
2. Add API call notification to form

### Step 1: Create API call notification

Create an API call notification using the webhook URL:

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
name: { name of your file here }
delay: '0'
enabled: true
format: http
headers: '{ "Content-Type": "application/json" }'
request_type: POST
to: { add your webhook URL here }
trigger_condition: t
---
{
	{ add your JSON payload here }
}
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

The payload used in this example: 

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
"text": "New Contact on Platform.OS.com!\nName: {{ form.properties.first_name }} {{ form.properties.last_name }}\nEmail: {{ form.properties.email }}\nPhone: {{ form.properties.phone }}\nComments: {{ form.properties.description }}"
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

{% include "alert/note", content: "You can customize your message in Slack quite a bit. Learn more about that on the page that provided you your webhook URL or on <a href='https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks'>api.slack.com/incoming webhooks</a>" %}

### Step 2: Add API call notification to form 

Add the following to the front matter on your form:

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
api_call_notifications:
- { name of your file here }
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

The front matter of the form we used in this example:

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
name: enquirer_signup
async_callback_actions:
  delay: 
  content: 
base_form: UserSignup::EnquirerUserSignup
configuration:
  name:
    validation:
      presence: {}
  password: {}
default_payload: "{}"
resource_owner: self
api_call_notifications:
 - slack_sales_request
email_notifications:
 - new_user_signup
---
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}
