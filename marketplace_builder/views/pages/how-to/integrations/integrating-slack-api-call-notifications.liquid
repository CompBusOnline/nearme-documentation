This guide will help you create a Slack integration for Platform OS using API Call Notifications. 

## Requirements
To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with creating API call notifications. You also have to have access to a Slack workspace, have enabled webhooks, and created an incoming webhook. You will need the webhook URL for creating the API call notification.  

* [Creating an API Call Notification](/get-started/notifications/creating-api-call-notification)
* [Creating an Incoming Webhook (Slack Documentation)](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks#getting-started)

## Steps

Integrating Slack using API call notifications is a two-step process:

1. Create API call notification
2. Add API call notification to form

### Step 1: Create API call notification

Your webhook URL looks similar to this: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
Create an API call notification using your own webhook URL (replace placeholder):

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
name: { name of your file here }
delay: 0
enabled: true
format: http
headers: '{ "Content-Type": "application/json" }'
request_type: POST
to: { your webhook URL, e.g. https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX }
trigger_condition: t
---
{
	"text": "New Contact on Platform.OS.com!
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

{% include "alert/note", content: "You can customize your message in Slack quite a bit. Learn more about that on the page that provided you your webhook URL or on <a href='https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks'>api.slack.com/incoming webhooks</a>" %}

### Step 2: Add API call notification to form 

Add the following to the front matter on your form:

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
api_call_notifications:
- { slack_sales_request }
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}

The front matter of the form we used in this example:

{% raw %}

<pre><code class="language-liquid">
---
name: enquirer_signup
resource: User
configuration:
  email:
  password:
api_call_notifications:
  - slack_sales_request
---
</code></pre>

{% endraw %}
