**Modules** allow code reuse and sharing, while protecting the IP of creators.

## Directory structure

Module code is split into 2 directories to protect IP. To create a module, split module code into `public` and `private` folders, and place all that code into the `modules/MODULE_NAME` directory.

```shell
modules
└── MODULE_NAME
    ├── public
    └── private
```

These directories have the same structure as the standard `marketplace_builder` folder, but if developers try to download files after the module has been deployed to an Instance (`marketplace-kit pull`), they will only see the files from the public folder.

You can create an Instance and deploy the code as you would usually do, and you still can have the `marketplace_builder` folder on the top level (this code will not be part of the module but you can use it while developing).

This mechanism allows creators to share their module code, make it configurable (by code in the `public` folder), but still protect the IP in the `private` folder.

### Example: Module directories

An example of module code split into two directories, inside the `modules` directory:

```shell
admincms
├── private
│   └── graph_queries
│       ├── get_customizations.graphql
│       └── get_pages.graphql
└── public
    └── views
        └── pages
            └── admin.liquid
```
