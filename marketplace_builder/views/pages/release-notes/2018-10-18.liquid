### {{ page.metadata.description }}

Some users reported that they have troubles running very long tasks in `async_callback_actions` because the task was too slow to execute.

Before you had no control or information about limits, errors, timeouts.

From now on you have full control over priority of your `async_callback_actions`.

If you don't set priority at all, it will be set to `default`.

#### Example

```yaml
{% raw %}
[...]

async_callback_actions:
  delay: 10
  priority: low
  content: >
    {% execute_query 'long_running_task' %}

[...]
{% endraw %}
```

#### Limits

| Priority | Timeout   |
|----------------|-----------|
| high           | 1 minute  |
| default        | 5 minutes |
| low            | 4 hours   |

Keep them in mind when writing code so that it runs fast enough for its priority.

#### Logging

Additionally, when job fails or timeouts it will be logged.
You can access that log using `marketplace-kit logs` command.
