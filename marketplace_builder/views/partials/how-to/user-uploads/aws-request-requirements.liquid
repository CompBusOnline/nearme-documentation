* Make sure your form is using POST method
* Make sure your form is sending data as `enctype="multipart/form-data"`  * Do not include any fields that are not listed in the `s3_upload` key, otherwise AWS will return error 403 with message `Invalid according to Policy: Extra input fields: xxx`
* Make sure file input is sent last in the form
* Remember to set your file input name to `file`
* Make sure you included `x-amz-meta-metadata` field even if it is an empty object (`{}`), lack of it will throw a validation error because AWS S3 is expecting it to be present.

All above are AWS requirements - [read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-HTTPPOSTForms.html).
