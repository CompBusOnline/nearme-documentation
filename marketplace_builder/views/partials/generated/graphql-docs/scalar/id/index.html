<a id="id" class="anchor" href="#id" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ID</h1>
<p>Represents a unique identifier that is Base64 obfuscated. It is often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as <code>"VXNlci0xMA=="</code>) or integer (such as <code>4</code>) input value will be accepted as an ID.</p>
