<p>GraphQL Interfaces are a sort of "parent object" from which other objects can "inherit" from. For example, <code>Stars</code> is considered an interface, because both <code>Repository</code> and <code>Gist</code> can be starred. An interface has its own list of named fields that are shared by implementing objects.</p>
