**Redirects** are used to redirect one page to another using an HTTP status code. 

## Example
Redirecting /my-page to /other-page using the 302 status:

{% raw %}

```yaml
---
slug: my-page
redirect_to: /other-page
redirect_code: 302
---
```

{% endraw %}

* `slug`: defines the URL at which this page will be accessible. In this example, assuming your site's domain is `https://example.com`, you will be able to access the page at `https://example.com/my-page`.
* `redirect_to`: endpoint which you want the user to be redirected to. 
* `redirect_code`: specifies the status of redirection. Can be either 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Found).
